### Item
Name goes here.

### What should it do? If possible, word it like how the game words item descriptions.
Don't worry too much about numbers - those are the easiest to change.

### Does this item overlap in function with any vanilla items, any items within this mod, or popular other ones?
If it does overlap, how does it separate itself?

### Considerations
What problem does the item solve? When would it be good? What survivors like the item? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

### Does the item have a high-res icon?
Check [Underlords](https://dotaunderlords.fandom.com/wiki/Items), and the [Trophy page](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Trophy). The icons actually in Dota 2 are 88x64, while these alternate locations sometimes have unique higher-res versions (256x256, usually, and the icons in this mod are 512x512 so minimizing upscaling is nice.)
